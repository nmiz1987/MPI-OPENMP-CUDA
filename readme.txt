# Parallel and distributed computing

The project was created as part of a parallel and distributed computing course.

The goal of the project is to create a program that receives input from the user and executes on it an algorithm for calculating a match using a parallel calculation.

During the study I learned how to use OPENMP, MPI and CUDA optimally.
